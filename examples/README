The reptile can rotate north, south, east, or west up to 270 degrees
at a time. A specific sensory pattern is designated for each direction.
The reptile's goal is to find the one pattern that, but it has no
memory of where it has previously searched. The reptile will starve
after a certain number of moves.

A more interesting example would be a more complex world with more than
the four directions the reptile could face patterns and actual
locomotive movement forward and backward.
