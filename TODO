1. Reorganize core CLA algorithms into cortical layers instead of regions to
   represent laminar structure of the cortex.

2. Allow tracing back predicted cell activity to recreate/recover a rough
   representation of the input pattern(s).

3. Differentiate receptive fields of ipsicolumnar cells with a partial
   overlap of the input instead of identical feed-forward activation
   patterns.
    a. partial overlap allows for better input reconstruction.
    b. how many temporal contexts can the current logic reliably support?

4. Localize lateral projection zone for distal dendrite segments. The local
   distance could be 1-2 receptive fields away. This is more biologically
   realistic.

5. Application: anomaly detection of real-time program execution.
    a. probably won't be as general as originally intended. the performance
       hit will be substantial for an arbitrary executable.
    b. best use case is for a specific executable designed for this application.
